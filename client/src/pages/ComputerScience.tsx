To be recognized by industrial houses as a source of consultancy and process management department always nurture students to develop innovative projects using innovative technologies. Students develop a project in each year of study starting from I year in the field of machine learning, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Big data, sales Force, IoT, image processing and Industry oriented projects using PHP, Python, and JAVA. AICTE sponsored MODROB Deep learning and Neural network Lab with RTX 8000 Quadro GPU is used for project development To showcase projects Department of Computer Engineering organizes a project exhibition “Udhbhav ” every year for students of all years. Computer Engineering, PIET in which around more than 100 projects were developed under NSP. The department holds its position of being the most innovative and research-oriented workplace so around 80% students of final year publish review Research papers in the area of smart computation and technology. Every faculty member publishes at least two papers each year. To encourage and to provide platform one International Conferences on Smart Computation and Technology (ICSCT)and ICIMMI have been organized.
